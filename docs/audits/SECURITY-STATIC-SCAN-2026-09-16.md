# Organization security static audit — 2026-09-16

## Verification mode
GitHub Actions step-level evidence is currently unavailable/incomplete, so this is a source-level security audit. A static clean result is not equivalent to a runtime security audit.

## Checks performed

| Check | Result | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| `pull_request_target` | No indexed matches | No occurrence found in the organization source index at audit time |
| `actions/checkout@main` | No indexed matches | No mutable `main` checkout reference found |
| private-key literal search | Matches are scanner definitions/docs, not confirmed credentials | No confirmed private key exposed by these matches |
| `unimplemented!()` | Canonical LKM stub found | Correctness/completeness finding, not itself a secret issue |

## Security findings

No confirmed credential exposure was established by the checks above. The canonical LKM loader does have a security-relevant fail-open symbol-validation defect: required unresolved imports are not rejected when `optional_deps` is empty. This is tracked as **F-20260916-006 / P1** in the engineering audit.

## Policy

Scanner-pattern matches inside security scanners and documentation are not classified as leaked credentials without evidence of an actual secret value. Kernel `unsafe`, `panic!`, and `unwrap()` occurrences require context-sensitive invariant review and are not automatically vulnerabilities.

## Next gate

Re-run the same checks after each security-related code change and require usable CI/test evidence before marking a security finding resolved.
